# rotki-balancer
Rotki Balancer is a simple Python script for balancing your crypto portfolio according to your own rules.

Here's what it looks like:

I have a simple system for "allocating" funds to different cryptocurrencies. I assign a percentage to each one, which is how much I intend to hold of those cryptos.

I can say that my assets should look like:
* 40% Bitcoin
* 20% Ethereum
* 10% Dogecoin
* 40% Tezos

and from there, be told what trades I need to execute to reach an intended total value.

The idea is that with regular use over time, this tool will help to build a balanced portfolio.

## Features
Features:
* Simulation mode: Want to show off or test Rotki without any actual assets? Simply write your config, then set simulation_mode: true, and Rotki Balancer will use randomised simulated balances (within 20% of your allocation).
* Allocation management - Buy only mode/Buy and sell mode
   * Buy only: Are you a long term holder? Turn on buy-only mode and Rotki Balancer will tell you how to get as close to your allocation as possible without selling anything.
   * Buy-and-sell: Balancer will tell you what to buy and sell to reach a perfectly balanced portfolio.
     * üöß In buy-and-sell mode, make sure to enter a desired held value of at least $1 higher than what you have, to make sure the Balancer still tells you buys and sells.
* Calculate the total value of your assets

## Bugs/antifeatures
* ERC20 tokens and NFTs are not supported yet, but I want to implement that "soon".
* This script **does not execute buy/sell actions for you** - and I will likely **never** implement that feature myself. It's purely advisory and can't directly eat people's money, and I like it that way :)

## Usage
Before using Rotki, ensure you have the "requests" and "pyyaml" Python modules installed (`pip3 install requests pyyaml`)

Then:
* Clone rotki-balancer from GitHub and put it somewhere safe
* Configure rotki-balancer by copying config.yml.dist to config.yml and customising it (see the section below for help)
* `cd` to the directory you cloned Rotki Balancer into
* Run `python3 balancer.py`

## Configuration
Here is a shortened version of the example configuration file we provide:
```
---
asset_allocations:
  - {asset: btc, allocation: 50}
  - {asset: eth, allocation: 25}
  - {asset: doge, allocation: 25}

floating_precision: 2
buy_only_mode: false
simulation_mode: false
```

**asset_allocations** is the main configuration for which assets (by ticker) you want to hold, and how much you wish to allocate to each.

In this example, Bitcoin makes up 50% of our portfolio, Ethereum makes up 25%, and Dogecoin 25%.

**floating_precision** sets the number of decimal places you want to use for displaying values in your currency.

In **buy_only_mode** (üíéü§≤) allows you to tell Rotki Balancer that you do not wish to execute any sells. In this mode, it will either suggest buys that will take you to a perfect allocation (if you have enough budget) or how to get as close as possible, as well as print your expected allocations after balancing.

In **simulation_mode** Rotki Balancer will use randomised simulated balances (within 20% of your allocation). This helps you avoid exposing your position directly when demoing Balancer or just trying it out.

## Roadmap
Planned features:
* üöß In progress: Load your balances from Rotki, filtered for just Blockchain assets
* Net worth mode: Calculate trades needed to reach your chosen allocation for your entire net worth in Rotki (as opposed to just your chosen assets). Net worth mode may be buggy if your desired allocation and your assets in Rotki cannot be reconciled to 100%.
* Overall allocation mode: Tell us how much of your portfolio you want in crypto, and we'll adjust your crypto allocation to match.
* (MAYBE) Support for other asset types in Rotki (e.g. Fiat, DeFi, etc)
* Add support for ERC20 + NFT assets
* Add support for non-USD currency calculations
